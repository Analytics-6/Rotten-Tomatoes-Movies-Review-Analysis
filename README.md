### Project Overview
Played the role of a host who does podcast on movie reviews and dug into Rotten Tomatoes data set to find interesting insights and share fun facts about movies.

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook - Data Analysis

### Packages
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn

### Key Objectives
- Explored the data and created three more columns to aid in further analysis
- Prepared and reformatted the data for visualizations
- Visualized data and identified key insights

### Findings
- Critics gave harsher reviews. There are quite a few low ratings in the tomatometer histogram
- The run time of movies seems to be correlated with the number of critic ratings
- The most popular movie is Shutter Island with lots of audience ratings and not as many critic ratings --
- This is so extreme that it could potentially be an outlier / error
